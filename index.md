    <h1>Project Scope</h1>
    
    <p>

    <h2>Background: Why We Do What We Do</h2>
    
    <p>
     Mental state can be predicted from social media data by analyzing at the user’s behavior and how it changes over time. According to a study1, whether internet interaction predicts changes in users’ well-being depends on how the users use it, such as the sites they visit, and who they interact with.

      <p>
       Social behavior is one indicator of mental state. A change in social behavior can indicate if they are experiencing changes in mental state. Numerous studies (2-5) have shown links between social interaction and mental wellbeing. In addition, recent studies (6-5) also show that some health outcomes, including mental state & emotions, can “spread” through social networks. Therefore, our project focuses on quantifying these social interactions, particularly within groups/communities and friends.

        <b> Why Groups? </b> Groups are akin to communities, which consist of people bonding over similar interests. This shows that groups are established social networks. There are two types of interactions that can happen: bridging social capital and bonding social capital8. General actions in these communities represent bridging social capital. Meanwhile, when a user tags others within those groups, it represents a bonding social capital, because it confirms that the action is indeed an act of friendship.

    <h2>Background: Why We Do What We Do</h2>
    
    <p>
     Mental state can be predicted from social media data by analyzing at the user’s behavior and how it changes over time. According to a study1, whether internet interaction predicts changes in users’ well-being depends on how the users use it, such as the sites they visit, and who they interact with.

      <p>
       Social behavior is one indicator of mental state. A change in social behavior can indicate if they are experiencing changes in mental state. Numerous studies2-5 have shown links between social interaction and mental wellbeing. In addition, recent studies^(6-7) also show that some health outcomes, including mental state & emotions, can “spread” through social networks. Therefore, our project focuses on quantifying these social interactions, particularly within groups/communities and friends.
